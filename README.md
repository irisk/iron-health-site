# Iron Health Awareness

A single-page website educating Dutch women about iron deficiency — specifically the gap between lab "normal" ferritin ranges (6-15 µg/L) and what's actually optimal for health and energy (30-70 µg/L).

## Why This Exists

Many women in the Netherlands have low ferritin levels that fall within lab reference ranges but are far below optimal. They experience fatigue, brain fog, and hair loss without realizing iron could be the cause. Dutch GPs often dismiss these levels as "normal."
