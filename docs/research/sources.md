## Ferritin Thresholds & Definitions

1. **Lancet Haematology — Ferritin threshold of 30 µg/L**
   - Defined iron deficiency at ferritin <30 µg/L with 92% sensitivity
   - This is the basis for our "30 µg/L minimum" recommendation
   - Citation: Defined ferritin <30 µg/L as iron deficiency with 92% sensitivity in absence of inflammation
   - *Note: Specific paper reference needed — commonly cited threshold in sports medicine and hematology literature*

2. **WHO Guidelines — Iron Deficiency**
   - WHO defines iron deficiency as ferritin <15 µg/L (general population) or <30 µg/L in the presence of inflammation
   - Source: WHO guideline on use of ferritin concentrations to assess iron status (2020)
   - URL: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240000124

3. **Lab Reference Ranges**
   - Dutch labs typically use 6-15 µg/L as lower bound of "normal" range for women
   - This is a population-based statistical range, not a health-optimized threshold
   - Range varies by lab; some use 10-15 µg/L as lower limit

4. **OLVG Amsterdam — Ferritin threshold raised to 30 µg/L**
   - OLVG Lab updated ferritin reference values effective October 1, 2024
   - New lower limit: >30 µg/L, unified for men and women (previously sex-specific and lower)
   - Acknowledges this will detect deficiency more frequently in women with menstrual blood loss
   - Published: November 28, 2024

5. **Isala Zwolle — Ferritin threshold raised to 30 µg/L**
   - Isala hospital raised women's ferritin threshold to 30 µg/L
   - Result: 30% more iron deficiency diagnoses

## Personal Hemoglobin Setpoint

6. **Foy et al. (2025) — Haematological setpoints (Nature)**
   - "Haematological setpoints are a stable and patient-specific deep phenotype"
   - Studied 12,407 healthy patients over 20 years
   - Intrapatient variation (within same person): CVs of 2-15%
   - Interpatient variation (between people): CVs of 5-30%
   - Individual variation is substantially narrower than the population reference range
   - Setpoints are heritable and associated with all-cause mortality
   - Hemoglobin CVI (within-person) ~2.8% vs CVG (between-person) ~6.6%

   - Speakers: Hilde Roijen (internist, Isala), Marlijn Hoeks (internist-hematoloog), Femke Veldman (huisarts)
   - Key message: ferritin 30 is the new minimum; old lab ranges are outdated
   - Introduces concept of "setpoint-Hb" — your personal hemoglobin baseline
   - Example: if your personal Hb is 8.7 mmol/L, then 7.7 mmol/L is a significant drop even though it's "normal"

## Ferritin Gender Disparity & Functional Threshold

23. **ASH 2023 — "Sex, lies, and iron deficiency"**
    - A call to change ferritin reference ranges
    - 30-50% of "healthy" women have zero bone marrow iron stores — so "normal" ranges codify disease
    - No physiological reason for sex-based ferritin ranges
    - Ferritin should be at least 50 µg/L for symptoms to resolve and iron metabolism to normalize
    - Three clinical trials showed iron for women with normal Hb but ferritin <50 µg/L significantly reduced fatigue

## Notes

- Sources marked with *Note* need specific paper references to be verified/updated
- Absorption percentages are approximate ranges from multiple studies
- The 2-hour rule is clinical consensus rather than from a single definitive study
- Internist's name appears as both "Roijen" and "Royen" in different sources — DOQ uses "Roijen", podcast uses "Royen". Needs confirmation.
