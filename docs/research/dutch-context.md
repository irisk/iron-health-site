# Dutch Healthcare Context

NL-specific information relevant to the site's audience and messaging.

## Prevalence in the Netherlands

- Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide and in the Netherlands
- Estimated 20-30% of menstruating women in Western countries have depleted iron stores (ferritin <15 µg/L)
- In the Netherlands specifically, menstruating women and young women are among the highest-risk groups
- *Note: Specific NL prevalence data should be sourced from RIVM (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu) or CBS statistics*

## Dutch GP Practices

### The "Paracetamol en Afwachten" Culture
- Dutch GPs are trained to be conservative — watchful waiting is standard practice
- Complaints like fatigue are common and often attributed to lifestyle factors first
- Iron testing may not be the first response to fatigue complaints
- GPs follow the NHG-Standaard (Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap guidelines)

### NHG-Standaard Anemie
- The NHG guideline focuses primarily on **anemia** (low hemoglobin), not isolated low ferritin
- Iron deficiency without anemia is less consistently addressed
- GP may check hemoglobin but not always ferritin
- If hemoglobin is normal, the investigation may stop — even if ferritin is low
- Does **not** incorporate the concept of personal hemoglobin setpoints

### Hospitals Already Changing: Ferritin ≥30 µg/L
- **OLVG Amsterdam**: Raised ferritin lower limit to >30 µg/L (unified for men and women) effective October 2024
  - Source: https://www.olvg.nl/verwijsnieuws/normaalwaarden-ferritine-aangepast/
- **Isala Zwolle**: Raised women's ferritin threshold to 30 µg/L → resulted in **30% more iron deficiency diagnoses**
  - Driven by internist Hilde Roijen

- These hospitals are ahead of the NHG guideline — demonstrating the gap between current GP practice and specialist knowledge

### Personal Hemoglobin Setpoint (Setpoint-Hb)
- Concept promoted by internist Hilde Roijen (Isala) and supported by Foy et al. Nature 2025 study
- Every person has their own stable hemoglobin baseline — your "setpoint"
- Within-person variation (~2.8%) is much narrower than the population reference range (~6.6%)
- Example: if your personal Hb is 8.7 mmol/L, a drop to 7.7 mmol/L is significant even though 7.7 is "normal" by lab standards
- The NHG-Standaard does not yet account for this — GPs currently only check against population thresholds
- Roijen describes a "Perfect Storm": arbitrary thresholds + no historical data access + normalization of fatigue in women

### What This Means for Patients
- You may need to specifically **ask for a ferritin test** (not just "blood work")
- If ferritin comes back at 12-15 µg/L, the GP may say "normal" — because it's within lab reference range
- Patients may need to advocate for treatment or a referral if symptoms persist
- Saying "ik wil graag mijn ferritine laten controleren" is a reasonable request

## Insurance & Cost

- **Blood tests**: Covered by basic insurance (basisverzekering) when ordered by GP
- **Ferrofumaraat** (prescription iron supplement): Covered by basic insurance
- **Over-the-counter supplements**: Not covered, but widely available at pharmacies (apotheek) and drugstores (Kruidvat, Etos)
- **No referral needed** for GP visit — the huisarts is the first point of contact

## Voedingscentrum (Dutch Nutrition Center)

- Official Dutch government nutrition advisory body
- Recommends 15mg iron/day for women aged 19-50
- Acknowledges vegetarians may need more

- *Note: Their recommendations are somewhat conservative compared to sports medicine literature*

## Common Dutch Iron Supplements

- **Ferrofumaraat** 200mg (= ~65mg elemental iron) — most commonly prescribed
- **Losferron** (ferrogluconaat) — effervescent, easier on stomach
- Available at all pharmacies; prescription versions are insurance-covered

## Cultural Notes for Site Messaging

- Dutch audiences respond well to **direct, factual** communication
- Avoid overly dramatic framing — stick to data and practical advice
- "Je" (informal you) is appropriate for health communication targeting younger women
- Medical self-advocacy is somewhat countercultural in the Dutch system — frame it as reasonable and empowering, not adversarial
